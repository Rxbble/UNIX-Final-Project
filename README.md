# Project Proposal

1. Project description/goals
For our project, we decided to choose the research and tutorial projects scenario. We decided to use Debian as our base operating system and create a desktop system specifically for our project. More specifically, we will make a desktop designed for athletes and sports fans. Our main objective is to provide users to browse through their favorite sports and fitness applications with ease. The user will also be able to download many softwares of their choice if they need depending if the packages are available.

2. Platform of choice and Demonstration Plan
Our platform of choice is a desktop. Our demonstration plan will be the Oracle VM Virtual Box using Debian. We chose to use a VM because we do not have a Linux OS installed. As well as the fact we are doing this project mostly at home, we decided to use VirtualMachine.This project will be accessible and updated via GitHub in order to document our workflow and errors.

3. Requirements
Basic system security: Users must enter a password to access our operating system after logging in. We will only provide the primary user full access as sysadmins, and we will only allow other users to read and execute.
Creating multiple user accounts: Using root, users can be made in the terminal and given distinct passwords.
Process or service management: We'll document our procedures and mistakes so that we may learn from them. We'll include instructions on how to install our operating system, along with passwords.

4. Major technical solutions compared:
Option 1: Debian, as we are both more accustomed to it and have used it as our main operating system for all of our labs. supported by the school computers as well.	

Option 2: Fedora

5. Timeline
Week 1: Analyze how to implement our ideas in the Virtual Machine
Week 2: Implementation + Testing
Week 3: Finishing touches, get ready for presentation
