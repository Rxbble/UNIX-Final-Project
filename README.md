# Project Objectives
For our project, we decided to choose the research and tutorial projects scenario. We decided to use Debian as our base operating system and create a desktop system specifically for our project. More specifically, we will make a desktop designed for athletes and sports fans. Our main objective is to provide users to browse through their favourite sports and fitness application with ease. The user will also be able to download many softwares of their choice if they need depending if the packages are available.
